## Conclusion
Due to 31% of the workforce is either retirement or mentorship eligible, there will most likely be many positions to fill over the next 5-10 years. Taking into consideration the low amount of employees who are eligible for mentorship, Pewlett Hackard will face a great deficit once a majority of eligible employees retire.

Two other ways to view the data of employees eligible for retirement and the mentorship program is which departments will have the most turnover within the next several years. 
- Employees eligible for retirement by department
  - 49% of the eligible employees are concentrated in two departments (Development & Production)

Due to the large concentration of employees eligible for retirment and/or mentorship program to two operations departments, Pewlett needs to start thinking of a plan to combat the turnover within th enext few years as a lot of knowledge will be leaving with them.
